### Analysis

![PolyVideo Example Analysis](https://i.ibb.co/twrYBfsQ/polyvideo-Demo-Pic.jpg, "PolyVideo Analysis")

Once the market data and YouTube videos have been pulled, you can jump around to any point in the video by clicking on the graph at locations of interest. Figure out where the big spikes were, jump to a couple minutes before them, and analyze away!

Hopefully this can be an unlock for journalists writing about events like debates, etc. I'm also working on a live version of this same project that will integrate iframes to allow you to use any type of live stream (though I fear that this will undoubtedly be used mostly for sports markets) and potentially even allow you to trade directly through that portal. If this is of interest please let me know on X, would love some betatesters.
