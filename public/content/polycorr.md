### Analysis

![PolyCorr Example Analysis](https://i.ibb.co/LhSmfQjs/polycorrdemo.jpg, "PolyCorr Analysis")

This project uses an LLM to take a guess at what assets will be directly and inversely correlated with a particular market (though the LLM doesn't do the best job most of the time) and allows you to then compare the normalized movements of these assets, along with any others you'd like to add, with the movements of the market.

### Limitations
1. **Data Fidelity** - There are limitations on the fidelity of data that can be pulled from both the financial markets and Polymarket. For longer term analysis, it would be best to compare at a day to day level instead of hour to hour.
2. **Market Hours** - Equity markets only trade during market hours while prediction markets are 24/7, so there will be obvious discrpencies in the data
