## Background: Pokemon Planet 

I'm at a pretty competitive person. I enjoy winning. Perhaps I take the pursuit of victory too far sometimes. 

In 11th grade I used to be obsessed with this game called Pokémon Planet (recently renamed Poke Nexus). This MMORPG allowed players to navigate through several regions, building their teams, trading items and Pokémon, and chatting with other trainers through the general channel. One day, a random user decided to start hosting daily Pokeno Unscrambling competitions with pretty cool projects. While I found myself being quite good at these, I'd really stopped keeping up with the new Pokémon after the release of X & Y, and thus was missing almost half the PokeDex. **So I decided to cheat**. 

After a bit of experimentation, I coded a simple engine that could take any phrase and return the unscrambled Pokémon. It was quite a fun little concept and while I did win almost every Pokémon Unscramble contest I competed in since then (don't worry I would never accept the prizes), this wasn't exactly something I could show off to my friends

## The Problem: Word Hunt

Game Pigeon's Word Hunt, on the other hand, was a game I had *absolutely no* natural aptitude for. I would regularly get hammered by my friends. I have no idea why I was so bad at this game in particular. I wanted to fix that too though, so I decided to cheat again.

This attempt at cheating, however, was quite a bit harder than the previous ones. Before this, my coding experience was extremely limited to the basics needed to operate robots. I was by no means an excellent coder. I'd never even done AP Computer Science A. I was, however, signed up to self-study and take that AP test in 5 months, so I decided now might be a good time to get started learning!
